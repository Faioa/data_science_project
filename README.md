## The project

We are thinking of using one of those two datasets to try to predict the popularity of a movie based on different parameters like the duration, the budget, the genre, etc.
- [Reduced Movies DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
- [Full Movies DataSet](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest)

Or we could try to predict which movie we would like based on the movies we already watched and liked (but it is a very common subject...).

It is still under discussion, but it will probably be one of these those.
